# ✨ Ramadan Problem Solving Challenge ✨

Welcome to the **Ramadan Problem Solving Challenge**!🌛 This is a 30-day challenge where we solve programming problems daily throughout Ramadan. The goal is to improve problem-solving skills, share knowledge, and grow as a community. 🚀

## 🌟 How It Works

- Each day of Ramadan, a new folder (`Day-1`, `Day-2`, etc.) will be added to the repository.
- Each folder contains:
  - **Problem statement** (link to the problem or description)
  - **Hints** (optional guidance to approach the problem)
  - **Solutions** in different programming languages
- Everyone is encouraged to contribute their solutions by making a **Pull Request (PR)**!

## 🏆 Challenge Rules

1. Try to solve the daily problem before checking the solutions.
2. Submit solutions in any programming language you prefer.
3. Keep your code clean and well-commented.
4. Follow the contribution guidelines below when submitting solutions.

## 🛠️ Contribution Guide

### 1. Fork the Repository

Click the `Fork` button at the top right of this repo to create a copy under your account.

### 2. Clone Your Forked Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Ramadan-Problem-Solving-Challenge.git
cd Ramadan-Problem-Solving-Challenge
```

### 3. Add Your Solution

- Navigate to the folder of the current day (e.g., `Day-5/`).
- Add your solution file inside the `Solutions/` subfolder. Example:

  ```
  Day-5/
  |-- Problem.md
  |-- Hints.md
  |-- Solutions/
      |-- your_solution.py
      |-- another_solution.cpp
  ```

- Use meaningful file names: `your_username_language.extension` (e.g., `hany_c++.cpp`).

### 4. Commit and Push

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added solution for Day-5 in C++"
git push origin main
```

### 5. Create a Pull Request

- Go to the original repository on GitHub.
- Click `Pull Requests > New Pull Request`.
- Select your fork and submit your solution!

## 🚀 Let's Solve Problems Together

📿Ramadan is a time of growth and reflection. Let's use it to grow our coding skills too. Feel free to invite friends and contribute as much as you can!
